Subqueries.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Write a query that uses a subquery to obtain all orders for the customer named
Cisneros. Assume you do not know his customer number (cnum).

->SELECT CNUM,ONUM FROM ORDERS
  	WHERE 
	CNUM = (SELECT CNUM FROM CUSTOMERS 
		WHERE CNAME = 'Cisneros');

2) Write a query that produces the names and ratings of all customers who have
above-average orders.

->SELECT CNAME,RATING FROM CUSTOMERS
	WHERE CNUM IN 
	(SELECT CNUM FROM ORDERS
	WHERE AMT > (SELECT AVG(AMT) FROM ORDERS));


3) Write a query that selects the total amount in orders for each salesperson for
whom this total is greater than the amount of the largest order in the table.

->SELECT SUM(AMT) FROM ORDERS
	GROUP BY SNUM
	HAVING 
	SUM(AMT) > (SELECT MAX(AMT) FROM ORDERS);
