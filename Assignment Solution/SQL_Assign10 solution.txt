------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Write a query that produces all pairs of salespeople who are living in the same
city. Exclude combinations of salespeople with themselves as well as duplicate
rows with the order reversed.

->SELECT N1.SNAME,N2.SNAME,N1.CITY FROM SALESPEOPLE N1,SALESPEOPLE N2
	WHERE N1.CITY=N2.CITY
  	AND N1.SNAME != N2.SNAME
	GROUP BY CITY;

2) Write a query that produces the names and cities of all customers with the same
rating as Hoffman.

->SELECT CNAME,CITY FROM CUSTOMERS
	WHERE RATING =(SELECT RATING FROM CUSTOMERS
    	 		WHERE CNAME = 'Hoffman');
