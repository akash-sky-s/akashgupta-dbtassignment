4) Why isnâ€™t it possible to see the first five rows of a table?
Ans:
>In a DBMS,Data is stored in a file.
>Data is stored sequentially in a DBMS(inside the file the data is stored sequentially).
>IN RDBMS,table is not a file, every row is a file.
>Rows of a table are not stored sequentially.
>Rows of a table are scattered(fragmented) all over the the DB server HD(this is common for all RDBMS).
>When you INSERT into a table,wherever the system finds the free space space in the DB server HD,it will store the row there.
>The reason that RDBMS does this, is to speed up the INSERT statement.
>When you SELECT a table,the order of rows in the output,depends on the row address.
>It will always be in ascending order of row address.
>When you UPDATE a row,if the row length is increasing,then the entire MAY be moved to some other address.
>Later when you SELECT from the table,you will find the row at some other position in the output.
>It's only in the case of VARCHAR that the row length may increase or decrease.
>Hence it is not possible to view the first five rows of a table.
