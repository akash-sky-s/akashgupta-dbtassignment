Creating Tables and Indexes.
====================================================================================

1) Write a command that will enable a user to pull orders grouped by date out of the
Orders table quickly.

->CREATE INDEX order_date on ORDERS(odate);

2) If the Orders table has already been created, how can you force the onum field to
be unique (assume all current values are unique)?

->CREATE UNIQUE INDEX O_NUM ON ORDERS(ONUM);

3) Create an index that would permit each salesperson to retrieve his or her orders
grouped by date quickly.

->CREATE INDEX I_DATE ON ORDERS(ODATE);

4) Let us assume that each salesperson is to have only one customer of a given
rating, and that this is currently the case. Enter a command that enforces it

->ALTER TABLE CUSTOMERS MODIFY RATING PRIMARY KEY;
