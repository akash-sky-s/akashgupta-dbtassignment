Querying Multiple Tables at Once.
---------------------------------------

1) Write a query that lists each order number followed by the name of the customer
who made the order.

-> SELECT ONUM,CNAME FROM ORDERS,CUSTOMERS
	WHERE CUSTOMERS.CNUM = ORDERS.CNUM;


2)Write a query that gives the names of both the salesperson and the customer for
each order along with the order number.

->SELECT SNAME,CNAME,ONUM FROM ORDERS,CUSTOMERS,SALESPEOPLE
	WHERE ORDERS.SNUM = CUSTOMERS.SNUM 
	AND   ORDERS.SNUM = SALESPEOPLE.SNUM;


3) Write a query that produces all customers serviced by salespeople with a
commission above 12%. Output the customer’s name, the salesperson’s name,
and the salesperson’s rate of commission.

->SELECT CNAME,SNAME,COMM*100 "RATE OF COMM." FROM CUSTOMERS,SALESPEOPLE
	WHERE CUSTOMERS.SNUM = SALESPEOPLE.SNUM
	AND COMM > 0.12;


4) Write a query that calculates the amount of the salesperson’s commission on each
order by a customer with a rating above 100.

->SELECT AMT,COMM FROM CUSTOMERS,ORDERS,SALESPEOPLE
	WHERE CUSTOMERS.SNUM = ORDERS.SNUM
	AND ORDERS.SNUM = SALESPEOPLE.SNUM
	AND RATING > 100
	ORDER BY RATING > 100;
